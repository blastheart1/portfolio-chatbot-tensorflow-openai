## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Lead Detection Triggers
The system automatically detects lead opportunities when users:
- Ask about **pricing** ("How much does a website cost?")
- Inquire about **services** ("What services do you offer?")
- Show **interest** ("I need a website built")
- Ask about **availability** ("Are you available for projects?")

### 2. Natural Conversation Flow
When a lead opportunity is detected:
- **Follow-up question** is asked first: "Would you like me to reach out to discuss your project needs in more detail?"
- **User response** determines next steps
- **Form appears** only if user shows interest
- **Polite acknowledgment** if user declines

#### **Example Conversation Flow:**
```
User: "How much do you charge for a website?"
Luis: "I offer three packages: Starter (‚Ç±22,000), Professional (‚Ç±45,000), and Enterprise (‚Ç±100,000)..."

[AI detects pricing interest - confidence: 0.8]
Luis: "Great question about pricing! Would you like me to reach out to discuss your project needs in more detail?"

User: "Yes, that would be great!"
[Form appears for lead capture]

OR

User: "No, not right now"
Luis: "No problem at all! Feel free to reach out anytime if you have questions about my services. I'm here to help whenever you're ready!"
```

### 3. Automated Follow-up
